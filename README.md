## Contributing

When starting to work on an issue, you need to create a branch from the `main` branch with the convention:

> `short-description-of-the-task`<br>

For example, if you're starting to work on "some-task", you first need to create a branch named `some-task` from the `main` branch. Then you can start working on that branch. You also should synchronize your branch with `main` branch by merging `main` branch into your branch (in this case `some-task`) periodically.

When you are about to commit, your commit message needs to follow these conventions stated here: [How to Write a Git Commit Message](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)   

After your task is done, you need to create a pull request. Note that you need to merge `main` branch to your branch before the pull request to minimize the chances of merge conflicts. 

And remember, the internet is your friend, consult internet whenever you stuck, as well as your teammates.

## React

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
